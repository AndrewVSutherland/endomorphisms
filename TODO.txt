Map to elliptic curves perfect: CM, signs, base point and transitions
Integrate improvements into algorithm run, try to use D0 if possible
Jacobian addition on Puiseux series via formal calculation

Later:
Update Decomposition functionality in Sage
Use Pari consistently
Determine the "right" map when not consistently taking projections or inclusions; the naive suggestion is to use the inverse and multiply out denominators, but that seems too large
Try to develop a bit further if the first branches coincide (the first time this can happen is in genus 4)
Divisor from Cantor? In principle this is all right: We pull back to X x Y^gY via the canonical map and then push to X x Y via idX x projection on the first coordinate. However, Magma cannot do this, since in it pushforwards are limited to maps between curves.

Projects:
Decomposition of endomorphism algebra
General symplectic subgroup determination and isogenies
Make theta derivatives fast
Implement Guardia in genus 3

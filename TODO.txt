Get rid of Weierstrass condition on X and normalization on that curve (after everything else!)

/* Proof!
f = y^4 - x^3 + x + 1 to y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
(x, y) --> (x, y^2)
dx / 2y becomes dx / 2y^2; it could not be simpler
dx / 2y^2 = y (dx / 2y^3) = 2y (dx / 4 y^3)
This depends on normalizations, so we need to fix the defining equation.
If we do that, then matrix is [ 0, 4, 0 ]

f = 1 - y^3*x - y*x^3 - x^4 to y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
1/x^4 - (y/x^3) - y/x - 1 to y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
(x, y) --> (y/x, 1/x^2)
dy / (3 x^2 + 1) becomes (-2/x^3) dx / (3 (y/x)^2 + 1)
= -2 dx / (3 y^2 x + x^3)
while dx / F_y = dx / (-3 y^2 x - x^3)

f = x^4 - y - y^3 - y^4 to y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
(x/y)^4 - (1/y^3) - 1/y - 1 to y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
(x, y) --> (1/y, (x/y)^2)
dx / 2 y becomes (-1/y^2) dy / (2x^2 / y^2) = (-1 / (2 x^2)) dy
while -dy / F_x = -dy / (4 x^3)
*/

/* Proof!
Say y^2 = 4 x^3 + g2 x + g3
Then (y / 2)^2 = x^3 + (g2 / 4) x + (g3 / 4)
So the latter has a map to the former that sends
(x, y) --> (x, 2 y)
Under this, d x / y pulls back to d x / 2 y

Say y^2 = x^3 + a x + b
Then d^6 y^2 = d^6 x^3 + a d^6 x + b d^6
Then (d^3 y)^2 = (d^2 x)^3 + a d^4 (d^2 x) + b d^6
Then there is a map to y^2 = x^3 + a d^4 x + b d^6, namely
(x, y) --> (d^2 x, d^3 y)
Under this map, dx / 2 y pulls back to (1/d) (dx / 2 y)

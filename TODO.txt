Better idempotent isolation
Factors of Jacobian via GSp operations
Better Analytic.m

Slay maps to elliptic curves once and for all (general point, not just Weierstrass, to point at inf)
Get rid of Extra when not needed: everything can be recovered from the homology
Stable root finding if LLL fails

Wrapper.py: document Sage part
FractionalCRT.m: reduction takes too much time
Branches.m, Divisor.m, Cantor.m: appropriate margins in various computations
Branches.m: make as fast as possible, add possibility to refine calculated approximation further when proceeding to higher degree
Divisor.m: get rid of Weierstrass condition (possible on one factor, on both if leading terms given)
Divisor.m: get rid of Weierstrass echelonization since it should not be needed
Divisor.m: automatically scale equations to ge a rational non-Weierstrass point
Debugging: Sato-Tate bug in CR's examples, understand rank 3 phenomenon in DS's example

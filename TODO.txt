G1, G2 Drew and general issues
Map to elliptic curves perfect, general base point from which to take these, transition maps correct on differentials
Integrate improvements into algorithm run, try to use D0 if possible
Jacobian addition on Puiseux series via formal calculation

Later:
Return only single factors for idempotents
Try to develop a bit further if the first branches coincide (this first happens in genus 4)
Divisor from Cantor? In principle this is all right: We pull back to X x Y^gY via the canonical map and then push to X x Y via idX x projection on the first coordinate. However, Magma cannot do this, since in it pushforwards are limited to maps between curves.

Projects:
Decomposition of algebra
General symplectic subgroup
Isogenous lattices in general

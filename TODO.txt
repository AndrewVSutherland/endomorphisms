Structure:
Perfect up to MaxIsotr.m, then think
TODOs and Compositum

Do polarizations and Prym absolutely right
May need to recalculate projection maps after reconstructing with twist (but probably not if done right)

Map to elliptic curves perfect, general base point, transition maps correct on differentials
Integrate improvements into algorithm run, try to use D0 if possible
Jacobian addition on Puiseux series via formal calculation

Later:
Try to develop a bit further if the first branches coincide (this first happens in genus 4)
Divisor from Cantor? In principle this is all right: We pull back to X x Y^gY via the canonical map and then push to X x Y via idX x projection on the first coordinate. However, Magma cannot do this, since in it pushforwards are limited to maps between curves.

Wrapper.py: document Sage part

PrettyPrint.py: pass around by using a class method

SatoTate.m: some cases fall through (see debug-cr)

Precision.m: recognition problems (see debug-cr)

FractionalCRT.m: reduction takes too much time

Branches.m, Divisor.m, Cantor.m: appropriate margins in various computations

Branches.m: make as fast as possible, add possibility to refine calculated approximation further when proceeding to higher degree

DecProjs.m: write a better function to find idempotents that uses the structure of the order

Divisor.m: get rid of Weierstrass condition (possible on one factor, on both if leading terms given)

Divisor.m: get rid of Weierstrass echelonization since it should not be needed

Divisor.m: automatically scale equations to ge a rational non-Weierstrass point
